# issueTracker

This is a tracker application that helps the user to manage problems.
Each problem is treated as a ticket. For each ticket, the user can 
add the detail of the problem, so that other users can view them and 
provide solutions.

This project uses the following technologies:

Python 3.10.4

Django 4.0.4

AWS Database

Bootstrap 5

Current functionality:

Display, create, edit and delete tickets

User Authentication

Forum for communication

Need to implement:

Delete comments

Use Password to login

Add levels of access for tickets
